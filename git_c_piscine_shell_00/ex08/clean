# This line looks for all the files that matches the naming rule and removes them
# Firstly, we search for files (-type f) that have a matching name (rules: a. Name ends with "~" char, b. Name starts and ends with "#" char). (-name "*~" -o -name "#*#" (worth mentioning is that "-o" flag doesnÂ´t stand for "output", but for "or")).
# Then we use the flag "-print" to print all the files for deletion.
# Lastly, we delete all the found files.
